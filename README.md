# Share Media

A module to easily share images and videos on a scene or in a popout to all or some players. This module is primarly focused on sharing illustrations (and others) without having to create multiple journal entries.

- Share embedded media in a journal entry
- Share embedded media in an actor sheet
- Share embedded media in an item sheet

This module is compatible with:

- [Kanka-Foundry](https://github.com/eXaminator/kanka-foundry)
- [GM Notes](https://github.com/syl3r86/gm-notes)
- [AppBar](https://github.com/xaukael/taskbar/)
- [Monk's Enhanced Journal](https://github.com/ironmonk88/monks-enhanced-journal/)

This module is inspired by the excellent [Journal-To-Canvas-Slideshow](https://github.com/EvanesceExotica/Journal-To-Canvas-Slideshow) module developed by EvanesceExotica.

## [API DOCUMENTATION HERE](API.md)

# How-to

## 1. Install

#### b. Videos

"Share Media" supports mp4 & webm videos. To insert a video in a text editor, click on the "Source code" button and copy/paste the following code:

```
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="path/to/your-video.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
```

Make sure to change the file path and the extension type. Then save.

_Note: videos are automatically played and **muted**._

## 3. Share an image or a video in a popout

Once an image or a video is inserted, hover over the media preview to display two buttons.

Hover over the first button to display two popout options:

- Click on "All players" to share the media to all players
- Click on "Selected" to share the media to some players

## 4. Share an image or a video on a scene

#### a. Bounding tile

To share an image or a video on a scene, you need to create a bounding tile on the scene. To do this, click on the "Create a bounding tile".
A bounding tile is a special type of tile automaticaly generated by this module. This bounding tile acts as some sort of area in which the media will be displayed. By default the bounding tile is created covering the whole scene canvas. You can resize a bouding tile just like a regular tile.

You can create multiple bounding tiles and therefore share multiple medias on the same scene!

#### b. Share

Hover over the second button to display two scene options:

- Click on "Fit" to share and resize the media and make sure it is fully visible
- Click on "Cover" to share and resize the media to cover the entire bounding tile (the media will most likely be cropped)

<img src="./readme-assets/helper6.jpg" height="400">

If multiple bounding tiles are created, clicking the "Fit" or "Cover" buttons will prompt to choose the bounding tile.

#### c. Clear

Click on the "Clear bounding tile" button and select the bounding tile to clear.

## 5. Share an image and video fullscreen

Once an image or a video is inserted, hover over the media preview to display two buttons.

<img src="./readme-assets/helper9.jpg" height="400">

Hover over the first button to display two popout options:

- Click on "All players" to share the media to all players
- Click on "Selected" to share the media to some players

<img src="./readme-assets/helper4.jpg" height="250">

Once the media is shared, a "Dismiss" button should appear. As the GM, you can click this button to dismiss the media for all players (only the GM can see this button).
A "Minimize/Maximize" button will show/hide the media being shared in fullscreen mode (client only, not synced).

## 6. Loop option (video only)

If the media is a video another button is displayed: the loop button option.
This button controls if the video is to be shared as a looping video or not.

If the video is **not** set to loop, then the video container will be hidden once the video has ended.

A general setting allows the user to set the default looping option for all videos.

## 7. Mute option (video only)

If the media is a video another button is displayed: the mute button option.
This button controls if the video is to be muted or not.

⚠️ ⚠️ Browsers have a special restriction about playing unmuted videos. The user must interact with the interface before (click on the canvas, open a character sheet, etc.), for a video to be played with sound. Because of this restriction, share media will try to play unmuted videos with sound (if needed), but if unable, will play them without sound. This could be the case for videos that are immediately played after the browser is reloaded or when no user interaction occurred.

A general setting allows the user to set the default mute option for all videos.

## 8. Notes

- "Share Media" creates a new layer just above the background layer (map & tiles)
- Videos are automatically played and muted
- If only one bounding tile is present on the scene the module won't prompt to choose between bounding tiles
- Resize a bounding tile to fit your needs
- When sharing a media, the source entity (journal entry, actor or item) will not be shared to the players. Only the media is.
